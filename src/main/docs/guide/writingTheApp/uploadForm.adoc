The `views` module provides support for view rendering on the server side and does so by rendering views on the I/O thread pool in order to avoid blocking the Netty event loop.

To use the view rendering features described in this section, add the following dependency on your classpath. For example, in `build.gradle`

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[tag=views]
----

Micronaut ships out-of-the-box with support for Apache Velocity, Thymeleaf or Handlebars. In this guide, we use Apache Velocity.

We are going to create a simple form:

Create a `home.vm` view:

[source, bash]
.src/main/resources/views/home.vm
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/views/home.vm[]
